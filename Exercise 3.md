## 📝 Homework Exercises – Git Recovery & Advanced Operations

### 📌 Exercise 8: Soft Reset Practice

**Objective:** Learn how to undo commits while keeping your changes.

- Create three commits with different files.
- Use `git log` to view the history.
- Run:

  git reset --soft HEAD~2

  to undo the last two commits but keep the changes staged.

- Recommit with improved messages.
- Verify the new log with `git log`.

### 📌 Exercise 9: Revert Simulationgg

**Objective:** Undo a commit safely without rewriting history.

- Make a change and commit it with a message like `"Break layout"`.
- Run `git log` and copy the commit hash.
- Run:

  git revert <commit-hash>

  to create a new commit that undoes the previous one.

- Confirm the result using `git log` and check your files.

### 📌 Exercise 10: Stash Use Case

**Objective:** Temporarily save uncommitted work.

- Edit two files without committing.
- Run:

  git stash

- Switch to another branch using `git checkout`.
- After switching back, run:

  git stash pop

- Run `git status` before and after stashing to observe changes.

### 📌 Exercise 11: Cherry-Pick Challenge

**Objective:** Apply a commit from one branch to another.

- Create a new branch `feature-a` and commit a change.
- Switch to `main` and run:

  git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

- Use:

  git log --oneline

  to confirm the commit appears on both branches.
